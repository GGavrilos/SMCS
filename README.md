# SMCS
This repository contains code and replication material for the simulations and case studies contained in Arnold et al (2024). The preprint can be found [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18678)
Here, you can find the following:

- The R functions and R files used to run Simulations 1,2, and 3. The code contains detailed comments, but you can also find more details in Examples 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, as well as in Section 4 of the preprint.
- The folder "Covid", containing the material used for the implementation of the first case study of the paper (Section 5). More information and references about the dataset used in this case study can be found both in the preprint, as well as in the original GitHub repository by [Cramer et al.](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6301718.svg)
- The folder "Wind_Gust", containing the material for the second case study appearing on the preprint. This material is tailored for running on a cluster.
- The folder "Plots" that contains all plots contained in Arnold et al. (2024).
