# SMCS
This repository contains code and replication material for the simulations and case studies contained in Arnold et al (2024). The preprint can be found [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18678)
Here, you can find the following:

- The R files used for Simulations 1,2, and 3. The code contains detailed comments, but you can also find more details in Sections 2 and 4 of the preprint.
- The R files used for the Simulation in a non-Gaussian setting (Supplement F.2 of the preprint).
- The R files used for the Simulation with unbounded loss functions (Supplement F.1 of the preprint).
- The folder "Covid", containing the material used for the implementation of the first case study of the paper (Section 5). More information and references about the dataset used in this case study can be found both in the preprint, as well as in the original GitHub repository by [Cramer et al.](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6301718.svg)
- The folder "Wind_Gust", with the material for the second case study appearing on the preprint.
- The folder "Plots" that contains all plots contained in Arnold et al. (2024).

The structure of all folders follows the Slurm pipeline, which was used to run the R scripts on the "Euler" Cluster of ETH ZÃ¼rich.
